==============================

About the dataset
----------------

This problem revolves around using survey to a select customer cohort.  We will be using the remaining data as a private test set.

Data Description:

* Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers
* X1 = my order was delivered on time
* X2 = contents of my order was as I expected
* X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order
* X4 = I paid a good price for my order
* X5 = I am satisfied with my courier
* X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me

Attributes X1 to X6 indicate the responses for each question and have values from 1 to 5 where the smaller number indicates less and the higher number indicates more towards the answer.
